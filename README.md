# Netflix SQL Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset using **SQL** to extract meaningful business insights. The analysis demonstrates strong skills in database creation, data querying, filtering, aggregation, and analytical thinking. The project is designed to showcase practical SQL knowledge suitable for **Data Analyst / SQL Developer** roles.

## Objectives

* Understand the structure of Netflix content data
* Perform exploratory data analysis using SQL queries
* Answer real-world business questions
* Strengthen hands-on SQL skills using MySQL Workbench

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to Netflix titles, including:

* Title name
* Type (Movie / TV Show)
* Genre
* Country
* Release year
* Date added to Netflix
* Duration and rating

## Tools & Technologies

* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench
* SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
* Git & GitHub

## Database Design

* Created a dedicated database for Netflix analysis
* Imported and structured the dataset into tables
* Ensured proper data types and integrity

## Key SQL Concepts Used

* Database & table creation
* SELECT queries
* WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
* Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
* Date functions
* Filtering and sorting data
* Basic data analysis logic

## Sample Analysis Performed

* Total number of Netflix titles
* Count of Movies vs TV Shows
* Content released per year
* Most common genres
* Country-wise content distribution
* Recently added titles
